# ft_printf

ft_printf("Just a printf");

It's just a job for printing.

Antique objects appear here,
it is your gateway to explore
the variadic functions.

They are good tools that help you make your
programs flexible.

The project is based on imitating
some printf function to print letters, 
sentences, and numbers, because putstr and putnbr
are not enough.
